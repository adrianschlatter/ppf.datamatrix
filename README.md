# ppf.datamatrix

ppf.datamatrix is a pure-python package to generate datamatrix codes. It
has been ported from
[datalog's datamatrix-svg](https://github.com/datalog/datamatrix-svg), which
generates datamatrix codes in javascript.

Datamatrix codes support a variety of character sets, namely EDIFACT, ASCII,
X11, and BASE64. ppf.datamatrix (as opposed to datamatrix-svg) currently
supports EDIFACT, only.
