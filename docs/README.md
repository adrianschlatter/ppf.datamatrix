ppf.datamatrix is a pure-python package to generate datamatrix codes in SVG.
Also, it integrates nicely in IPython.

ppf.datamatrix has been ported from [datalog's
datamatrix-svg](https://github.com/datalog/datamatrix-svg), which is written in
javascript.  If you like to see what you'll get before installation, check out
their [nice web demo](https://datalog.github.io/demo/datamatrix-svg).

Creating a datamatrix with ppf.datamatrix is as easy as

```
from ppf.datamatrix import DataMatrix

myDataMatrix = DataMatrix('Test!')
```

If you are working in a graphically enabled IPython terminal, you'll see your
datamatrix immediately:

Using the DataMatrix object, you get the SVG source like this:

```
myDataMatrix.svg()

'<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><svg ...'
```

<img alt="Test! DataMatrix" src="./imgs/Test.svg" width="50em">

Use this on your website, to stamp a pdf, to uniquely identify a drawing, or
whatever you like.  Background and foreground color are configurable by
specifying fg and/or bg arguments.  Create a light blue matrix on a petrol
background like this:

```
myDataMatrix.svg(fg='#EEF', bg='#09D')
```

<img alt="Test! DataMatrix in red on blue background" src="./imgs/Test_colored.svg" width="50em">

Note: This sets the colors of the SVG.
It does *not* change the color of the representation inside your IPython terminal.


## Advanced Features

ppf.datamatrix supports a [variety of
encodings](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Matrix#Encoding), namely
EDIFACT ('datamatrix.edifact'), ASCII ('datamatrix.ascii'), X12
('datamatrix.X12'), C40 ('datamatrix.C40'), TEXT ('datamatrix.text').  These
are used to store your message inside the datamatrix code efficiently.
DataMatrix handles the encoding internally: If you just want to create a
DataMatrix, you don't have to care about any of this.  If you want to do
advanced stuff (designing your own form of matrix code, maybe), ppf.datamatrix
enables you to use its encoders.  After importing ppf.datamatrix, they are
available via the python codecs system:

```
import ppf.datamatrix

encoded = 'TEST'.encode('datamatrix.edifact')
encoded
b'\xf0PT\xd4'

decoded = encoded.decode('datamatrix.edifact')
decoded
'TEST'
```


# Installation

ppf.datamatrix is available via [pypi](https://pypi.org):

```
pip install ppf.datamatrix
```
