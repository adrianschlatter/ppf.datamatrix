# How to contribute

Thank for considering a contribution! Any help is greatly appreciated.


## Did you find an issue?

* Check whether your issue has already been reported by searching under
  [existing issues](https://github.com/adrianschlatter/ppf.datamatrix/issues).

* If don't find an issue addressing the problem, open a new issue.

* Choose a meaningful title, describe clearly what you consider to be a
  problem.

* If possible, provide example code or other means to make it easy for a
  maintainer to reproduce your problem.


## Contributing Code

You want to help with a bug or contribute a feature? The [development
docs](./dev/DEVDOCS.md) might help you along. 

You already have a solution for an issue or a new feature? All the better! A
pull request ("PR") is what you want to do.

* Open a new [pull-request](https://github.com/adrianschlatter/ppf.datamatrix/pulls)
  with your patch.

* Try to create PRs that address a specific issue/feature/topic.

* Avoid PRs containing an assortment of unrelated fixes and features. Better
  split it into separate PRs for each topic.

* Clean up your code before creating a pull request: Remove code that you have
  commented out for debugging, remove test code you have added.

* Make sure the PR's description clearly describes the problem and your
  solution. Include relevant issue numbers if appropriate.

* You increase the chances of quick acceptance of your PR significantly if you
  have taken measures to assure quality (such as writing and passing tests).
